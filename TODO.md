## PENDING

- get db url from config
- fix failing tests and CI
- finish doing recursive atomizer




## IDEAS
- Refactor recursive atom parser into other package
(is it even a good idea to do it? there is no GC of atoms)
- Collect stats from the server header response and have a stats and health service GenServer (?)
- Some sort of rate limiting and routing on the client side (?)
- GraphQL API (?)
